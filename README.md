# Data Visualization Capstone
Angular.js Front-End Website for Marketing and Brand

Forked from [ngBoilerplate](http://joshdmiller.github.com/ng-boilerplate), an opinionated kickstarter for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) projects.

***

## Quick Start

Install Node.js and then:

```sh
$ cd ~/path/to/web
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `file:///path/to/ng-boilerplate/build/index.html` in your browser.

> Remember: 
> EDIT files from /src/
> OPEN files from /build/

### Overall Directory Structure

At a high level, the structure looks roughly like this:

```
ng-boilerplate/
  |- grunt-tasks/
  |- karma/
  |- src/
  |  |- app/
  |  |  |- <app logic>
  |  |- assets/
  |  |  |- <static files>
  |  |- common/
  |  |  |- <reusable code>
  |  |- less/
  |  |  |- main.less
  |- vendor/
  |  |- angular-bootstrap/
  |  |- bootstrap/
  |  |- placeholders/
  |- .bowerrc
  |- bower.json
  |- build.config.js
  |- Gruntfile.js
  |- module.prefix
  |- module.suffix
  |- package.json
```

More information on each directory:

- `karma/` - test configuration.
- `src/` - our application sources. [Read more &raquo;](src/README.md)
- `vendor/` - third-party libraries. [Bower](http://bower.io) will install
  packages here. Anything added to this directory will need to be manually added
  to `build.config.js` and `karma/karma-unit.js` to be picked up by the build
  system.
- `.bowerrc` - the Bower configuration file. This tells Bower to install
  components into the `vendor/` directory.
- `bower.json` - this is our project configuration for Bower and it contains the
  list of Bower dependencies we need.
- `build.config.js` - our customizable build settings; see "The Build System"
  below.
- `Gruntfile.js` - our build script; see "The Build System" below.
- `module.prefix` and `module.suffix` - our compiled application script is
  wrapped in these, which by default are used to place the application inside a
  self-executing anonymous function to ensure no clashes with other libraries.
- `package.json` - metadata about the app, used by NPM and our build script. Our
  NPM dependencies are listed here.

### Detailed Installation

`ngBoilerplate` uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.org) as its build system, so
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) is required. Also, Grunt by default no longer comes
with a command-line utility and Karma and Bower must end up in your global path
for the build system to find it, so they must be installed independently. Once
you have Node.js installed, you can simply use `npm` to make it all happen:

```sh
$ npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
```

* (If you're on Linux then throw `sudo` in front of that command.  If
you're on Windows, then you're on your own.)

Assuming you're starting from scratch, simply clone this repository using git:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/joshdmiller/ng-boilerplate my-project-name
$ cd my-project-name
```

And then install the remaining build dependencies locally:

```sh
$ npm install
```

This will read the `dependencies` (empty by default) and the `devDependencies`
(which contains our build requirements) from `package.json` and install
everything needed into a folder called `node_modules/`.

There are many Bower packages used by `ngBoilerplate`, like Twitter Bootstrap
and Angular UI, which are listed in `bower.js`. To install them into the
`vendor/` directory, simply run:

```sh
$ bower install
```

To ensure your setup works, launch grunt:

```sh
$ grunt watch
```

The built files are placed in the `build/` directory by default. Open the
`build/index.html` file in your browser and check it out! Because everything is
compiled, no XHR requests are needed to retrieve templates, so until this needs
to communicate with your backend there is no need to run it from a web server.
With this setup, any file that
changes will trigger only those build tasks necessary to bring the app up to
date. For example, when a template file changes, the templates are recompiled
and concatenated, but when a test/spec file changes, only the tests are run.
This allows the watch command to complete in a fraction of the time it would
ordinarily take.

In addition, if you're running a Live Reload plugin in your browser (see below),
you won't even have to refresh to see the changes! When the `watch` task detects
a file change, it will reload the page for you. Sweet.

When you're ready to push your app into production, just run the `compile`
command:

```sh
$ grunt compile
```

This will concatenate and minify your sources and place them by default into the
`bin/` directory. There will only be three files: `index.html`,
`your-app-name.js`, and `your-app-name.css`. All of the vendor dependencies like
Bootstrap styles and AngularJS itself have been added to them for super-easy
deploying. If you use any assets (`src/assets/`) then they will be copied to
`bin/` as is.

Lastly, a complete build is always available by simply running the default
task, which runs `build` and then `compile`:

```sh
$ grunt
```

### Live Reload!

`ngBoilerplate` also includes [Live Reload](http://livereload.com/), so you no
longer have to refresh your page after making changes! You need a Live Reload
browser plugin for this:

- Chrome - [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)
- Firefox - [Download from Live Reload](http://download.livereload.com/2.0.8/LiveReload-2.0.8.xpi)
- Safari - [Download from Live Reload](http://download.livereload.com/2.0.9/LiveReload-2.0.9.safariextz)
- Internet Explorer - Surely you jest.

Note that if you're using the Chrome version with `file://` URLs (as is the
default with `ngBoilerplate`) you need to tell Live Reload to allow it. Go to
`Menu -> Tools -> Extensions` and check the "Allow access to file URLs" box next
to the Live Reload plugin.

When you load your page, click the Live Reload icon in your toolbar and
everything should work magically.

If you'd prefer to not install a browser extension, then you must add the
following to the end of the `body` tag in `index.html`:

```html
<script src="http://localhost:35729/livereload.js"></script>
```
